CHIP THE GLASSES AND CRACK THE PLATES

  FAR OVER THE MISTY MOUNTAINS COLD  

       O! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?        

    CLAP! SNAP! THE BLACK CRACK!     

   FIFTEEN BIRDS IN FIVE FIR TREES   

 THE WIND WAS ON THE WITHERED HEATH  

 OLD FAT SPIDER SPINNING IN A TREE!  

         ROLL-ROLL-ROLL-ROLL         

   THE KING BENEATH THE MOUNTAINS    

  UNDER THE MOUNTAIN DARK AND TALL   

       THE DRAGON IS WITHERED        

         SING ALL YE JOYFUL!         

       ROADS GO EVER, EVER ON
